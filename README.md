# Copy AWS IAM role

This is a little script to help with creating a new IAM from from an existing one.

It will copy trust relationship policy, inline policies and managed polcies (both AWS- and customer-managed).

## Usage

You need Node.js to run the script. If you don't have it installed locally, you can run it in Docker.

Since the script calls AWS SDK it expects AWS credentials to be set in environment variables.

```bash
npm install

node copy-role.js SOURCE_ROLE_NAME TARGET_ROLE_NAME
```

Example output:

```bash
root@7142abe7b6c8:/var/app# node copy-role.js copy-role-poc copy-role-poc-target-role
